  # Comments use "#"
  # Int = whole number, Float = decimal
  # None = special datatype (ex: when you have 3 rows and the second one is blank)
  # Operators (PEMDAS) +,*,/,-,% (remainder), //(round down division), == (Boolean), !=
  # Var= Subject to change (age = 29)
  # Built in Functions (EX: str(),int(),type(), etc.)
  # Custom Functions: def = define, parameters = name we grant to an input of a function, return = what we want out of the code
  # str: Imutable = incapable of change, mutable = capable of change, str is imutable, in = is the item on the left in the right text
  # Lists: mutable data structure that holds collection of elements, append() = adds to list, pop() = removes last item in list
  # index positions and slicing: index of any word is -1 of len, [1:3] - never pulls the last number,left side: starts with 0 when counting, going backwards: start with -1
  # Dictionary an unordered collection of key-values pairs {}, dictionary_name{key being added: value being added, etc}, pop(key) = returns value but also removes pair from dictionary, dictionary.Values(shows values in your dictionary)
